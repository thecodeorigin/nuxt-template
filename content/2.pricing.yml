  items:
    - label: How does your pricing model work?
      content: Different tiers consume credits at different rates. Stronger instances consume more credits. You can top up credits from your dashboard.
    - label: Do you offer a free tier?
      content: No, we do not offer a free tier. All instances require credits to run.
    - label: What happens if I run out of credits?
      content: If your credit balance reaches zero, your n8n instance will continue running for 7 days. After that, it will be deactivated until you add more credits.
    - label: Can I cancel my instance and get a refund?
      content: Canceling an instance does not refund cash but returns unused credits to your account. However, canceling an instance costs 1 dayâ€™s worth of credits based on its tier.
    - label: Can I upgrade or downgrade my instance?
      content: Yes! You can change your instance tier at any time. The new credit consumption rate will apply immediately.
    - label: Where can I top up my account?
      content: You can top up your account with credits from your dashboard. If you make a payment from the pricing page, our system will automatically create a new n8n instance for you.
    - label: How does billing work?
      content: Your instance consumes credits daily. As long as you have enough credits, your instance will stay active.
    - label: Do you offer refunds?
      content: We do not offer cash refunds. If you cancel an instance, any remaining credits (minus the 1-day cancellation cost) will be returned to your account.
    - label: Do you offer support?
      content: Yes! We offer support for all plans, ensuring you get assistance when needed.
